# Prestige

  Prestige SF is a self-organized network of people with a common agenda, cause, and interest in sharing ideas, 
information and resources. The goal is to create a one of a kind member-driven experience for the creative and 
business professional in the San Francisco Bay Area. The concept was to create a hub for the forward thinking 
individual who canâ€™t be put in a box. Offering a built-in network and a wealth of professional contacts, 
the founders wanted to give members a space they could call their own. Whether hosting business meetings, 
corporate events or our own private parties, our membership tiers will include VIP access to the venue, giving our 
clients an experience like no other. We strive to push the culture forward by never compromising on quality, 
enhancing the community and making our own rules.
